# CityTeam Guests Application

Welcome to the Guests Checkin application for CityTeam Facilities.  It supports checking
in overnight Guests, assigning them to mats, and tracking (by name) for statistical
reporting purposes.

The server portion of this application is based on [Node JS](https://nodejs.org), with
its persistent data stored in a [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) database.  The client
portion is a pure HTML plus Javascript application (built with technologies like
[React](https://reactjs.org), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), and
[Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)), and runs inside a web browser.  It works
best with [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com), but will work in a slightly
degraded fashion on other browsers like Firefox, Safari, and Edge.  Internet Explorer
(any version) is specifically *not* supported.

The following links contain more information about installing and using the application.
* [Installation](./INSTALLATION.md).  Installation and operation instructions
  (primarily aimed at Windows 10 platforms, but it will work on Mac or Linux based
  platforms as well).
* TODO: Other documentation.
